    <p id="intro-paragraph">
    I have a passion in content creation and helping others convey their message/reach their target audience. Through video editing for all markets, genres and purposes, I want to take all the unnecessary stress and workload that comes with editing and give you a final edit within 48 hours of your purchase!

 <h4 id="About-me"> About Me </h4>         
 <p id="About-p">My name is Angus. I am 20 years old and over the last 18 months I have dedicated my time away from work, study and my social life to mastering the art of editing through Adobe Premiere Pro, and would like to transfer these skills into freelance work and eventually a business. I also taught myself how to code this website and I have a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CoBgiG3Pct-/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=">certificate</a> in online marketing! </p>


 <h4 id="Buy"> How To Purchase! </h4>
 <p id="Buy-p"> In order to purchase, go to the menu bar at the top of the page and click "checkout". There you will be presented with a range of prices based on what you would like the length of your final edit to be. After you make a purchase, a GOOGLE DRIVE link will be sent to you via email and SMS in order for you to upload the footage/videos you would like edited. 48 hours later the final edit will then be uploaded to the same GOOGLE DRIVE folder for you to download. </p>
